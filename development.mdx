## Prerequisites

You need **Node.js v19+** installed. If you're on an older version, upgrade first — the Mintlify CLI won't work properly otherwise.

<Info>
  If you have a legacy `mint.json` file, run the Mintlify upgrade command to convert it to `docs.json` and delete the old file.
</Info>

## Install & Run

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Then navigate to wherever `docs.json` lives and start the dev server:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're live.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. To use a different port:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the port is already in use, it automatically picks the next one:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Keeping the CLI Updated

Each CLI version is tied to a specific Mintlify release. If the local preview looks different from production, update:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

Before pushing, run this to catch any broken internal links:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

Push to `main` and the Mintlify GitHub app deploys automatically. You can also deploy manually from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

If the deploy succeeds, you'll see this on the commit:

## IDE Setup

I use VSCode with these extensions:

- [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) — syntax highlighting for `.mdx` files
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) — auto-formatting

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This is usually an outdated Node version:
    1. Remove mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19+
    3. Reinstall: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Something broke and I have no idea why">

    Delete the `~/.mintlify` folder and run `mintlify dev` again. This clears the local cache and fixes most mystery issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Check the [CLI changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify?activeTab=versions) if you want to see what changed between versions.
