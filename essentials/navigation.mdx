The navigation menu is the list of links on every page of the site.

You need to update `docs.json` every time you add a new page. Pages don't show up automatically.

## Navigation Syntax

The navigation syntax is recursive, so you can nest groups inside groups. Page names don't include the `.mdx` extension.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": ["quickstart"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
              "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
              "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>

You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.

</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hidden Pages

MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.
