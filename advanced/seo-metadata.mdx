Mintlify handles most SEO automatically, but I still make sure every page has good frontmatter. Here's what I do.

## Frontmatter on Every Page

Every `.mdx` file starts with this:

```mdx
---
title: 'Clear, Specific Title'
description: 'What this page covers in 50-160 characters'
icon: 'font-awesome-icon-name'
---
```

The `title` becomes the browser tab title and the `<h1>`. The `description` becomes the meta description for search engines and the preview text when someone shares the link.

<Warning>
  Pages without a `description` get generic meta tags. Always fill it in.
</Warning>

## What I Keep in Mind

### Titles
- Under 60 characters so they don't get truncated in search results
- Specific: "Code Blocks & Syntax Highlighting" not "Code"

### Descriptions
- 50-160 characters
- Summarize what the reader will learn
- Front-load the important keywords

### Links
- Always root-relative: `/essentials/markdown` not `../markdown`
- Descriptive anchor text: `[configure navigation](/essentials/navigation)` not `[click here](/essentials/navigation)`

### Headings
- Logical hierarchy: `##` then `###` then `####`
- Every heading creates an anchor link and shows up in the right-side table of contents

## Site-Level Config

In `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "humanlup docs",
  "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg"
  }
}
```

The `name` shows in the browser tab. The favicon and logo handle branding.

## Sitemap

Mintlify generates `sitemap.xml` automatically from everything in `docs.json` navigation. Pages not in navigation won't be in the sitemap (but they're still accessible via direct links and search).

## Social Sharing

When someone shares a link, the `title` and `description` from frontmatter generate the preview card. No extra config needed — just make sure every page has both.
