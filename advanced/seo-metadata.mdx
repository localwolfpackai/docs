Good documentation needs to be discoverable. Mintlify handles many SEO best practices automatically, but you can fine-tune how your pages appear in search results and social media shares.

## Page Frontmatter

Every MDX page should include frontmatter with `title` and `description`. These are used for:

- **Browser tab titles** and search engine result page (SERP) headings
- **Meta description** tags for search engine snippets
- **Open Graph** and **Twitter Card** metadata for social sharing

```mdx
---
title: 'Your Page Title'
description: 'A clear, concise description of what this page covers (50-160 characters ideal)'
---
```

<Warning>
  Pages without a `description` in frontmatter will have generic meta descriptions, which hurts search visibility.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Titles

- Keep titles under 60 characters so they display fully in search results.
- Use descriptive, specific titles: "Authentication with Bearer Tokens" is better than "Auth".
- Include relevant keywords naturally in the title.

### Descriptions

- Write descriptions between 50 and 160 characters.
- Summarize the page content in a way that tells users what they'll learn.
- Include primary keywords near the beginning of the description.

### Internal Links

- Use **root-relative** links (`/essentials/markdown`) instead of relative links (`../markdown`) for faster navigation and better crawlability.
- Link related pages to each other to create a strong internal link structure.
- Use descriptive anchor text: `[configure navigation](/essentials/navigation)` is better than `[click here](/essentials/navigation)`.

### Headings

- Use a logical heading hierarchy (`##` then `###` then `####`).
- Each heading creates an anchor link and appears in the table of contents.
- Include keywords in headings where it reads naturally.

## Site Configuration

The `docs.json` file controls site-level metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Lupo Studios",
  "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg"
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  Your project name. Used in the browser tab title and site header.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="favicon" type="string">
  Path to the favicon file. SVG format is recommended for sharpness at all sizes.
</ResponseField>

## Sitemap

Mintlify automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` for your documentation site. This file is submitted to search engines and includes all pages listed in your `docs.json` navigation.

<Tip>
  Pages not listed in `docs.json` navigation won't appear in the sitemap, but they are still accessible via direct links and the search bar.
</Tip>

## Social Sharing

When someone shares a link to your docs on social media, the page's frontmatter `title` and `description` are used to generate the preview card. Ensure every page has both fields set for consistent, professional link previews.
