This page covers two things: the built-in MDX components I use on this site, and the AI agent tools and skills that are part of my daily workflow.

## AI Agent Tools I Use

These are the tools I actually run. Not a wishlist — these are installed and configured.

### Claude Code

My primary coding agent. I use it for everything from writing code to managing git workflows.

```bash
# install skills for Claude Code
npx skills add claude-code

# or browse what's available
npx skills search
```

<Tip>
  Check out [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) for the full directory of agent skills. It's like a package manager for AI agent knowledge.

### MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol servers give agents access to external tools. The ones I use most:

- **Filesystem** — lets the agent read/write files on disk
- **GitHub** — PR creation, issue management, repo search
- **Fetch** — HTTP requests from within agent context
- **Memory** — persistent context across sessions

### Agent Workflow

My typical flow:

1. Open Claude Code in the project directory
2. Describe what I want to build or fix
3. The agent reads the codebase, makes changes, runs tests
4. I review and push

<Warning>
  Always review agent-generated code before pushing. Agents are fast but not infallible.
