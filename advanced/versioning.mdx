I don't use versioning yet since I'm solo, but I set this up for when I need it. Here's how it works.

## Turning It On

Add `versions` to `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "versions": ["v2.0", "v1.0"]
}
```

First in the array = default (latest). A dropdown appears in the nav bar.

## Two Ways to Handle It

### Separate Pages Per Version

Create different folders and wire them up:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Docs",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "version": "v2.0",
            "pages": ["v2/quickstart", "v2/migration"]
          },
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "version": "v1.0",
            "pages": ["v1/quickstart"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Same Pages with Version Callouts

For pages that are mostly the same, just add a note:

```mdx
## Authentication

All API calls require a Bearer token.

<Note>
  **v1.0 users**: API key auth is also supported. See the [v1 migration guide](/v1/auth).
</Note>
```

## My Plan

When I eventually need versioning, I'll probably go with shared pages + callouts for minor differences, and separate page trees only for major version breaks.

<Tip>
  If you're solo and only have one version, don't bother with this. Add it when you actually need it.
