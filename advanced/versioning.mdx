As your product evolves, you may need to maintain documentation for multiple versions. Mintlify supports version management through the `docs.json` configuration.

## Setting Up Versions

Add the `versions` field to your `docs.json` to enable a version dropdown in the navigation bar:

```json
{
  "versions": ["v2.0", "v1.0"]
}
```

The first version in the array is treated as the default (latest) version.

## Organizing Versioned Content

### Option 1: Version-Specific Pages

Create separate pages for each version and reference them in the appropriate navigation groups:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Docs",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "version": "v2.0",
            "pages": ["v2/quickstart", "v2/migration"]
          },
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "version": "v1.0",
            "pages": ["v1/quickstart"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Shared Pages with Version Notes

For pages that are mostly similar across versions, use callout components to highlight differences:

```mdx
## Authentication

All API calls require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

<Note>
  **v1.0 users**: API key authentication is also supported. See the [v1 migration guide](/v1/auth).
</Note>
```

## Version-Specific Anchors

You can show or hide navigation anchors based on the selected version:

```json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API v2",
      "url": "api-v2",
      "version": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "API v1 (Legacy)",
      "url": "api-v1",
      "version": "v1.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Default to latest**: Put the newest version first in the `versions` array.
- **Deprecation notices**: Add `<Warning>` callouts to deprecated version pages directing users to upgrade.
- **Shared content**: Use [reusable snippets](/essentials/reusable-snippets) for content that's identical across versions to avoid duplication.
- **Migration guides**: Always provide a migration guide when releasing a new major version.

<Tip>
  If you only maintain one active version, you don't need to configure versioning at all. Only add it when you need to support multiple concurrent versions.
