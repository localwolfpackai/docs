## Clone and run

```bash
# grab the repo
git clone https://github.com/localwolfpackai/docs.git
cd docs

# install the CLI (one time)
npm i -g mintlify

# start the dev server
mintlify dev
```

That's it. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're looking at the live site.

<Tip>
  If you already have Mintlify installed and things look weird, update it: `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
</Tip>

## How this site works

Every page is an `.mdx` file — basically Markdown that also supports React components. The sidebar, tabs, colors, and everything else are controlled by one file: `docs.json`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file" title="Add a new page">
    1. Create a new `.mdx` file anywhere in the repo
    2. Add frontmatter at the top:
    ```mdx
    ---
    title: 'My New Page'
    description: 'What this page is about'
    ---
    ```
    3. Add the file path (without `.mdx`) to `docs.json` navigation
    4. Refresh your local dev server — it shows up
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Change the look">
    Edit `docs.json`. The `colors` object controls the theme. `navigation` controls the sidebar. `logo` swaps the logos. It's all one file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Deploy">
    Push to `main`. The Mintlify GitHub app picks it up and deploys automatically. You can also deploy manually from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
