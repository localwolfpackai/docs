## Set up your development environment

Learn how to clone, edit, preview, and deploy your documentation site.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your GitHub with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally with this command:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```

    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `docs.json` is):
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      ```bash
      npm i -g mintlify@latest
      ```

      And run the upgrade command in your docs repository:

      ```bash
      mintlify upgrade
      ```

      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
    </Note>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the GitHub app">
  Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the GitHub app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
