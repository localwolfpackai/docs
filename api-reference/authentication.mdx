All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your token in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Using Bearer Tokens

Add the following header to all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://sandbox.mintlify.com/plants \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://sandbox.mintlify.com/plants",
    headers=headers
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://sandbox.mintlify.com/plants", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Obtaining a Token

API tokens can be generated from your account dashboard. Each token is scoped to a specific project and can be revoked at any time.

<Warning>
  Never expose your API token in client-side code, public repositories, or log output. Store tokens in environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, the API returns one of these error responses:

| Status Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid authentication token. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token is valid but does not have permission for the requested resource. |

```json
{
  "error": 401,
  "message": "Invalid or expired authentication token"
}
```

## OpenAPI Security Scheme

The authentication scheme is defined in the OpenAPI specification as follows:

```json
{
  "securitySchemes": {
    "bearerAuth": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "bearer"
    }
  },
  "security": [
    {
      "bearerAuth": []
    }
  ]
}
```

This means all endpoints in the specification require Bearer authentication by default unless explicitly overridden.
