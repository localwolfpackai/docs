<Info>
  Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify your application when specific events occur. The plant webhook fires whenever a new plant is created in the store.
</Info>

## Usage Notes

- Your endpoint must return a `200` status code to acknowledge receipt. If the webhook does not receive a `200` response, it may retry the delivery.
- The request body contains the full plant object including its `id`, `name`, and optional `tag`.
- Webhook payloads are sent as `POST` requests with a `Content-Type: application/json` header.

### Example Payload

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "name": "Fiddle Leaf Fig",
  "tag": "indoor"
}
```

### Handling Webhooks

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/webhook/plant", methods=["POST"])
def handle_plant_webhook():
    plant = request.get_json()
    print(f"New plant added: {plant['name']}")
    return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200
```

```javascript Node.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/webhook/plant", (req, res) => {
  const plant = req.body;
  console.log(`New plant added: ${plant.name}`);
  res.status(200).json({ status: "received" });
});
```
