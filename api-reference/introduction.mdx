This is a working example of API docs auto-generated from an OpenAPI spec. I use it as a template for any project that needs API documentation.

## How it works

Mintlify can generate interactive API docs from an [OpenAPI spec](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup). You write the spec, create thin MDX wrappers for each endpoint, and the framework handles the rest — request/response schemas, auth headers, try-it-out playground.

## Base URL

```
https://sandbox.mintlify.com
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/plants` | List all plants |
| `POST` | `/plants` | Create a new plant |
| `DELETE` | `/plants/{id}` | Delete a plant by ID |

## Webhooks

| Event | Path | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| New Plant | `/plant/webhook` | Fires when a plant is created |

## Auth

Everything uses Bearer tokens. See the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page.

## Errors

All errors return JSON with `error` (status code) and `message`:

```json
{
  "error": 400,
  "message": "What went wrong"
}
```
