The Plant Store API provides a RESTful interface for managing a collection of plants. This reference documents all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Overview

There are two ways to build API documentation with Mintlify: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). This documentation uses the OpenAPI approach, which auto-generates interactive endpoint pages from a specification file.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://sandbox.mintlify.com
```

## Available Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/plants` | Retrieve all plants the user has access to |
| `POST` | `/plants` | Create a new plant in the store |
| `DELETE` | `/plants/{id}` | Delete a plant by its ID |

## Webhooks

| Event | Endpoint | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| New Plant | `/plant/webhook` | Fires when a new plant is added to the store |

## Authentication

All endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Include your token in the `Authorization` header:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

See the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page for detailed setup instructions.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes. Error responses include a JSON body with `error` (status code) and `message` fields:

```json
{
  "error": 400,
  "message": "A description of what went wrong"
}
```

| Status Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Success |
| `204` | Success (no content) |
| `400` | Bad request or unexpected error |
| `401` | Authentication required |
